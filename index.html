I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/about/departments/mathematical-electrical-engineering">IMT Atlantique</a> (Brest, France) and <a href="https://labsticc.fr/en">Lab-STICC</a>, UMR CNRS 6285 (French CNRS laboratory). I am also a member of the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/odyssey/">Odyssey</a> joint research team (with INRIA and Ifremer). My main research interest is how to build data-driven models for solving inverse problems and emulating large numerical models in geosciences.
