## Under construction (as PI, co-PI or WP leader)

**2025-** co-PI in the proposal to answer Horizon Europe project "Closing knowledge gaps on Earth system science in support of global and regional assessments and climate policy" (*HORIZON-CL5-2026-08-Two-Stage-D1-06*).

**2025-** WP leader for the *ESA proposal Retroklim*. Developed a physically guided, diffusion-based generative consistency downscaling framework to extend the C3S CERRA reanalysis back to 1950 using parallel ML models (ERA5/ERA5-Land predictors), delivering high-resolution national climate datasets for Denmark’s Klimaatlas.

## Funded projects (as PI, co-PI or WP leader)

**2024-2026** *ESA CROSCIM*: Developed a methodological, generative-modeling and neural–data-assimilation–driven processing system leveraging Copernicus Expansion mission data (CRISTAL, ROSE-L, CIMR) to deliver advanced near–real-time Arctic operational products, including sea-ice metrics, snow thickness, and sea-surface-height forecasts.

**2022-2024.** *4DVarNet-OFDA*: 4DVarNet emulators for Ocean Forecasting and Data Assimilation. Copernicus Marine Service Evolution projects.

## Funded projects (as collaborator)

**2023-2025.** *AI4PEX*: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Enhanced Representation of Processes and Extremes in Earth System Models.
 
**2020-2024.** *OceaniX* for “Physics-Informed AI for Observation-driven Ocean AnalytiX”, from the ANR AI Chair program

**2019-2023.** *MELODY* for “Bridging geophysics and MachinE Learning for the modeling, simulation and reconstruction of Ocean DYnamics“, from the ANR program
